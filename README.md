### A cheapðŸ˜²PWM speed controller that can handle 30A (more with  a heatsink) for my pond pump  

Having installed a pond pump there came the inevitable "upgrade" request: "Can we make the pump more controllable?".

## Well Yes, we can as it happens. 

### Products  
Any PWM controller will adjust the speed of a motor like this. But I couldn't face building one, so I bought a cheap one off the Internet (Amazon UK, actually):

You can get them cheaper if you are prepared to wait for a while, see this one from AliExpress:

**Identical products (apparently), just a different price. Pays your money, takes your choice.**  

I found a video on YouTube by **RJ Imagination** that demonstrates the same circuit (pretty much):

I also found a circuit diagram for a 555 Timer PWM too:

A reasonable MOSFET for use by Arduino users (ie a 5v GPIO voltage) not suitable for ESP32 use (not without a level shifter):
